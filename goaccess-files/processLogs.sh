# This script does a few things to process the nginx logs into GoAccess reports
# First it loops through all the non empty .log files in the shared volume
# (there should only be one per app/domain combo)
# For each one it:
# - Creates a directory for all the app reports if it doesn't exist
# - Copies the live log file into a temporary $rotateLog
# - Empties the original log file
# - Creates a new GoAccess report with the temp log file
# - Then gzip's the temp log to archive it and so it won't be picked up by the loop
# The reason for doing the copy then truncate is to avoid needing to send the
# "kill -USR1 `cat /var/run/nginx.pid`" signal to NGINX to have it pick up a new log file
# because this container doesn't have access to the NGINX of course.

# After creating the reports, this also checks to see if there are any logs and reports older
# than the days specified by the $LOG_RETENTION_DAYS environment variable and deletes them if so
